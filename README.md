We propose an innovative framework called RoPGen, which learns authors’ unique coding style patterns that are hard for attackers to manipulate. The key idea is to incorporate data augmentation and gradient augmentation to learn robust coding style patterns. 

We use four datasets: the first two are used in the literature and the last two are introduced in our work. 

(1) GitHub-C dataset 
 
(2) GCJ-Java dataset

(3) GitHub-C dataset

(4) GCJ-Java dataset
